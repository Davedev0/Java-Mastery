## Introduction

Java is a widely-used programming language known for its portability, performance, and security. It's a great choice for beginners because of its object-oriented structure and extensive community support.

## Setup

Before you start coding in Java, you'll need to set up your development environment.

1. **Install Java Development Kit (JDK)**:
   - Download the latest JDK from the [Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) or [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.java.net/).
   - Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

2. **Install an Integrated Development Environment (IDE)**:
   - Popular IDEs for Java include [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/), [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/), and [NetBeans](https://netbeans.apache.org/).
   - Download and install your preferred IDE.

3. **Set up your IDE**:
   - Configure your IDE to use the JDK you installed.
   - Create a new Java project to start coding.

## Basic Concepts

1. **Hello World**:
   - Create a simple Java program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.

   ```java
   public class HelloWorld {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           System.out.println("Hello, World!");
       }
   }
